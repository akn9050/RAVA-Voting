### Welcome to Rava Voting.
A cryptographically secure voting system for truly democratic elections.
Are fair elections possible? Yes!

### Introduction!
Democracy depends on the proper administration of popular elections. Voters should receive
assurance that their intent was correctly captured and that all eligible votes were correctly
tallied. The election system as a whole should ensure that voter coercion is unlikely, even
when voters are willing to be influenced. These conflicting requirements present a significant
challenge: how can voters receive enough assurance to trust the election result, but not so
much that they can prove to a potential coercer how they voted?
Rava is a system that solves these problems and provides cryptographically secure e-voting.
