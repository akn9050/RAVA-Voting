{"name":"Rava Voting","tagline":"Evoting system","body":"### Welcome to Rava Voting.\r\nA cryptographically secure voting system for truly democratic elections.\r\nAre fair elections possible? Yes!\r\n\r\n### Introduction!\r\nDemocracy depends on the proper administration of popular elections. Voters should receive\r\nassurance that their intent was correctly captured and that all eligible votes were correctly\r\ntallied. The election system as a whole should ensure that voter coercion is unlikely, even\r\nwhen voters are willing to be influenced. These conflicting requirements present a significant\r\nchallenge: how can voters receive enough assurance to trust the election result, but not so\r\nmuch that they can prove to a potential coercer how they voted?\r\nRava is a system that solves these problems and provides cryptographically secure e-voting.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\nRava Voting is currently in active development, and it is not ready to be used yet.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Roland (@androideveloper)\r\n* Aram (@aramgev)\r\n* Vahan (@vahan8)\r\n* Aram \r\n\r\n### Questions?\r\nContact rava.voting@gmail.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
